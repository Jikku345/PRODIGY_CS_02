
This project is a simple **Image Encryption Tool** using Python and the **Pillow** library. It encrypts and decrypts images by manipulating pixel values through mathematical operations and pixel swapping. The tool provides a user-friendly **Tkinter GUI** to allow easy selection, encryption, and decryption of images. 

### **Features**:
✅ Encrypt images using pixel manipulation  
✅ Decrypt images back to their original form  
✅ Simple and intuitive Tkinter GUI  
✅ Supports multiple image formats (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP)  
✅ Error handling for invalid inputs

# 🖼️ Image Encryption Tool

This project is a simple **Image Encryption Tool** using Python and the **Pillow** library. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Encrypt images using pixel manipulation
- ✅ Decrypt images back to their original form
- ✅ Simple and intuitive Tkinter GUI
- ✅ Supports multiple image formats (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP)
- ✅ Error handling for invalid inputs

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow
- Tkinter

## 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-encryption-tool.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd image-encryption-tool
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pillow
```

## ▶️ Usage
1. Run the script:
```bash
python image_encryption.py
```
2. Select an image using the **"Open"** button.
3. Click **"Encrypt"** to encrypt the image.
4. Click **"Decrypt"** to restore the original image.
5. Save the encrypted or decrypted image using the **"Save"** button.

## 📸 Example
| Encrypted Image | Decrypted Image |
|----------------|----------------|
| ![Encrypted](./encrypted_image.png) | ![Decrypted](./decrypted_image.png) |

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Large images may take longer to encrypt/decrypt.
- Lossless encryption is ensured only if no other processing occurs between encryption and decryption.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add more complex encryption techniques.
- Improve GUI with better design and error messages.
